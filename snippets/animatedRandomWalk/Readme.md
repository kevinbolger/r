# Animated Random Walk by Kevin Bolger

This R script creates a random walk of a user specified nsteps.

The plots are captured and transformed in to an animated gif by the R animation package.

There are other inputs the user can customise, but the most basic and one without a default is nsteps.

## Also try: snake = TRUE

This is my favourite feature of this module. It allows you to set a snake of default length 3, which moves around the screen taking the path of the random walk.

## Ideas for improvments

Feel free to take this code and add to it.

- Add feature to prevent snake colliding in to itself.
- Add error handling
- Add more graphical controls
- Condense the repetitive portions of the code
- Further code cleanup/re-organisation
